From time to time someone asks how do I contribute to Open Source DFIR. This
page contains relevant tips and links from such conversations.

## First determine a scope in which you want to contribute

Open Source DFIR is combination of multiple very broad topics. First try to
determine a scope. If you are new to either open source or DFIR start we
recommend to small, you and extend the scope at any point in time.

Some questions that could help in determining a scope to start with:
